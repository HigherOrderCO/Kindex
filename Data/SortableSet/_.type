//* Sortable Collection using Bottom-Up MergeSort

// This collection is represented as a list of ordered lists and its total size
// Every ordered list will have distinct sizes. More precisely, a power-of-2 size
// P.S.: We use the term Set instead of Collection on the code, for brevity

// Based on Chris Okasaki's "Purely Functional Data Structures", Chapter 3.5.2 - 1996
