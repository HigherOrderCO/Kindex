# Binomial Heap

A Binomial Heap is represented as a list of tree nodes, ordered crescently on rank

A tree node of a Binomial Heap is composed of:

- Its rank, which determines its size and how many children it has;
- Its root value, which is lower than the values from its children (The min-heap property);
- Its children, represented as a list of tree nodes.
