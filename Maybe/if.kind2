//Verifies if your "Maybe" is none or some, if none returns the first value, if
//some, returns the second
//example: (Maybe.if Nat Nat (Maybe.none Nat) (Nat.zero) (Nat.succ Nat.zero)) -> (Nat.zero)
Maybe.if <a> <b> (m: (Maybe a)) (none: b) (some: b) : b
Maybe.if a b (Maybe.none t) none some = none
